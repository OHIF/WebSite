                <h1>For Imaging Professional</h1>


                <p>The OHIF Zero-footprint web based diagnostic workstation fills the need for a truly open, fully featured image review and analysis tool that is compliant with standardized diagnostic workstation functionality according to IHE BIR (Basic Image Review) profile. Most diagnostic workstations currently available are commercially closed source and share many of the same shortcomings:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Complexity due to the need to support multiple clinical scenarios</li>
                    <li>Long development cycles</li>
                    <li>Many require installable clients</li>
                    <li>Many require specific computing hardware</li>
                    <li>Most do not provide interoperability with other vendors</li>
                </ul>

                <p>OHIFâ€™s approach is a fully open-source, standards compliant platform for diagnostic interpretation, that is modular and extensible enough to support other specific interpretation workflows such as quality assurance, point-of-care visualization, research and teaching. It is expected to have minimal hardware requirements which will allow it to be deployed in underprivileged regions of the world in an fast, cost-efficient way.
